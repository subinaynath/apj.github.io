                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, in full <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, (born October 15,
                    1931, Rameswaram,
                    India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in
                    the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002
                    to 2007.</p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
                    Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958
                    joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite
                    launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned
                    the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname
                    “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile,
                    which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
